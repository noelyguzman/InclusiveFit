## Inspiration
The journey began with a simple yet profound realization: fitness is a universal right, not a privilege. We realized how there are no apps on the market that cater to individuals of ALL abilities. Inspired by stories of individuals facing barriers to fitness due to physical disabilities, we set out to create InclusiveFit, an app designed to make fitness accessible to everyone. Our mission was clear: to empower users of all abilities with personalized workout plans that respect their unique needs and preferences.

## What it does
 InclusiveFit revolutionizes the way individuals with disabilities engage with fitness by offering customized workout plans that adapt to each user's specific needs and abilities. Through an intuitive interface, users can input their preferences, abilities, and goals, allowing InclusiveFit to generate accessible, effective, and enjoyable workout routines. From wheelchair-friendly exercises to adaptive strength training and flexibility workouts, InclusiveFit ensures that fitness is inclusive, empowering, and within reach for everyone.
